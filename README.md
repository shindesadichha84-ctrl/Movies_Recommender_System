🎬 Movie Recommender System
This project is a Movie Recommender System built using content-based filtering. It suggests similar movies based on user input by analyzing the metadata (such as genre, cast, crew, keywords, and overview) of thousands of films.

📌 Features
📂 Loads and merges movie metadata from TMDB

🧹 Cleans and preprocesses data (handling missing values, converting JSON-like strings)

🧠 Extracts important features: genres, cast, crew, keywords, overview

🔍 Uses TF-IDF and Count Vectorizer for text vectorization

📏 Calculates cosine similarity to find similar movies

💡 Simple function to recommend top N similar movies

📦 Deployable using Streamlit or other frameworks

🚀 How it Works
Data Preparation:

Merges movies.csv and credits.csv

Extracts relevant fields and formats them

Text Processing:

Creates a "tag" column combining important fields

Applies text normalization and vectorization

Similarity Calculation:

Computes cosine similarity across the tag vectors

Recommendation:

Suggests top 5 movies similar to a given title
